Reviewer 1 (ilan samish)
1. I don't know the word limit of the tilte but the journal editor should consider changing the paper's editor to reflect the fact that a single case-study (GPI-hTfR1) is analyzed rather than the general phenomenon of virus-receptor binding. This is needed especially as different case-studies often produce different results. Indeed, the authors well articulate already in the abstract and then in the introduction the weak spots of the field. In the same line of thought, the case-study differences and the analyzed data is not only b/c of PPI problems. An important paper in the field that caused David Baker to work hard on the problem is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19561092 where it shown the mutation prediction is good on average but not in each case-study. Actually, the authors may want to refer to this paper in their mutation analysis. Likewise, steered MD was already used for PPI e.g. Cuendet M, Michielin O. 2008 which the authors cite.

The title was misleading.  It has been changed to the following to reflect to scope of the manuscript.

Analyzing Machupo virus-receptor binding by molecular dynamics simulation

2. The authors imply that their methodology is new. Yet, steered MD is a common methods and was used also for mutaions e.g. pubmed I (PMID: 23836247 ). The relevant statement should be softened. 

Thanks for pointing us to the referenced paper.  We were collecting data and finishing up writing this manuscript substantially before that paper was published so we missed it.  We have softened our language to:

  Here we propose applying an existing method to a new test case to probe mutational effects in protein--protein interactions directly based on first principles simulation, by pulling two proteins apart that are initially bound in a complex.

In addition we removed a misleading sentence.

  By extending the SMD technique to investigate a protein--protein interaction we have, in many ways, changed the scope of its application. 

3. The spring constant was set to 5 kcal/mol/ Ëš A and the velocity set to 1 A/ns. This choice of parameters should be discussed in light of other SMD publications as are the other choices within the SMD protocol. In this discussion, differences should be highlighted and explained.

4. in section 3.2 you write: "For SMD, at the centroid of 176
several atoms a force was applied to a single point in GP1." Readers should be able to generally repeat the simulation and actually the choice of the atoms to be pulled may affect results. Thus, the list of pulled atoms should be attached as a supp material.

We intended to upload the namd input parameters, but it was overlooked in the final submission.  In addition, we expanded the following paragraphs to include the requested information:

We used the final state from each equilibrated system to restart another MD simulation. Our steering protocol is fundamentally similar to \citet{Cuendet2008} with slightly different parameter choices. Perhaps the one significant difference lies in our choosing to not use a thermostat or barostat. However, this should not be a problem since we are not trying to calculate the binding free energy via the physically rigorous Jarzynski inequality. Following equilibration, the final state of each simulation was used to generate a configuration file fixing the $\alpha$-carbon on residues 1, 58, 73-83, 96, 136, 137, 138, and 161 (again with linear numbering) in the hTfR1. These residues were selected as they are far from the binding interface and sufficiently distributed to prevent any orientational motion of the receptor relative to the viral spike protein. The $\alpha$-carbon of all residues (163-318 in linear numbering) in the GP1 received an applied force during the simulation. The NAMD convention does not actually apply a force to all $\alpha$-carbon atoms, but rather uses the selection to compute an initial center of mass. Then, during the steering run, the single center of mass point is pulled with the parameters desribed below. We used the same periodic boundary conditions found in the equilibration run. In addition, we used the same force field parameters (exclude, cutoff, switching, etc.), the same integrator parameters (time step, rigidbonds on, all molecular being wrapped, etc.), and the same particle mesh ewald parameters.

In every way possible the subsequent steering simulation had the same parameters as the equilibration simulation. Thus, the steered molecular dynamics (SMD) \citep{Is2001A,Is2001B} simulation was a typical restart with slightly different settings. Periodic boundary conditions were incorporated as part of the system and PME was again used to approximate full system electrostatics. In addition, we ran test simulations at several spring constants, and visually inspected the results. A spring constant of 5~kcal/mol/\AA$^2$ was chosen due to its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. This is slightly lower than the more common 7~kcal/mol/\AA$^2$ found in several recent studies; however, it seems that value is so commonly selected primarily because it is the spring constant found in the NAMD, SMD tutorial. Moreover, the spring constant could very likely be set to a range of nearby values with little loss in power. Then, in SMD experiments the pulling velocity should be as low as possible for the available computational time. Thus we choose a velocity of 0.000001~\AA/fs = 1~\AA/ns, and direction down the positive $z$-axis. This number could be set to pull faster if the computing time must be reduced. 

Reviewer 2 (Matteo Masetti)

1. Methods are not enough detailed.
Why did the authors use a steering force acting on all alpha carbon instead of the more common choice of either steering just one atom or COM of one of the two counterparts? Are the authors using the protocol introduced by Cuendet and Michielin?
If so, this must be clearly stated, otherwise much more details should be reported in the Methods section regarding the steering procedure.
Moreover, certain methodological details are reported in the Results (see page 8, rows 176, 177), increasing the difficulty in understanding the steered MD procedure.

See response to points 3 and 4 in the first review.  We also removed the methods found in the results and added the important bits to the methods.

2. In the Results, at page 7 (rows 140 to 143), the authors state that large structural rearrangements of an interfacial flexible loop are expected upon binding, and they claim that because of this traditional computational tools are of limited usefulness. While one might agree with this sentence, the authors seem to overlook the fact that such a rearrangement complicate any other simulative strategy as well. How does this loop behave during steered MD simulations?
Does it unfolds or it stays in place?
A more detailed structural analysis is required.

3. As a follow up of the previous point, where are the mutations located relatively to the protein-protein interface?
Are they located in the flexible loop? In this case, how do the complexes "react" to the mutations?
Are there major rearrangements or just local motions during the production runs preceeding the pulling phase?
Very basic analysis such as computing the RMSD over time and RMSF per residue should be performed and reported.
Moreover, showing the location of these mutations in Figure 1 would improve the comprehension of the manuscript.

***Need to address with RMSF with the original simulations

4. I acknowledge the authors that probing the viability of the approach to point mutations before moving to more challenging cases is a good practice, and I also appreciate the fact that they do not overemphasize their results.
However, if I properly understood, the only experimental validation of the protocol is provided by three point mutations which returned two statistically insignificant correct results (N348K, vR111A) and one statistically significant wrong result (Y211T).
Unfortunately, this is not enough to support the steered MD protocol.
I suggest the authors to enrich the paper in either one of the two following ways:
1. by performing a detailed comparative analysis of the interactions and their changes upon mutations along the steereing phase (both from a structural and energetic point of view, e.g. by calculating the interaction energies as reported in the Cuendet and Michielin paper, by monitoring hydrogen bonds braking/formation and so on),
OR
2. to compare the steered MD results for the three alanine point mutations with more established free energy approaches (FEP or TI, see for example the recent paper by Luitz and Zacharias, Proteins 2013 81:461).

We have performed FEP with all of the same mutations.  The analysis includes the following...

5. In the Results, at page 7 (rows 140 to 143), the authors state that large structural rearrangements of an interfacial flexible loop are expected upon binding, and they claim that because of this traditional computational tools are of limited usefulness. While one might agree with this sentence, the authors seem to overlook the fact that such a rearrangement complicate any other simulative strategy as well. How does this loop behave during steered MD simulations?
Does it unfolds or it stays in place?
A more detailed structural analysis is required.

We agree. In principle, such flexibility would complicate any simulative study, but probing such rearrangements would really be impossible for a technique like MM/PBSA or FEP.  At least with SMD (or a few related techniques) the computational overhead to achieve such rearrangements does not increase substantially as the number of mutations increases as in FEP.

***Should we do this analysis?  We have more than 500 SMD runs to analyze.

6. In the Introduction, at page 1, (rows 14 to 17), the authors state that methods such as FEP and TI rely on a two state model, "with no intermediate steps". This is in a best case scenario a misleading sentence, since FEP and TI are computational frameworks that, in order to return meaningful results, in most of cases DO NEED intermediate steps. In fact, the sentence is also misleading since the authors refer to these methods as to "two state models" whereas they are generally known as "pathway methods" to be easily distinguished by "endpoint methods" such as MM-PBSA, LIE, ..., where only ensemble averages of certain endpoint properties are used without intermediate states!
This source of confusion must be properly addressed.

We weren't clear in the explanation. We meant to imply that large ending state transitions become computational intractable, and as a result, large changes can require a large number of intermediate (and expensive) calculations. The section now reads.

However, the currently available methods such as free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) rely on a transitional model (where one state may be wild-type and the other may be a mutant) that phases from one three-dimensional model to another \citep{Gilson1997,Lu2004,Chodera2011,Gumbart2013}. The free energy calculations in FEP are carried out in the forward and reverse phasing directions. As the two ending states look ever more dissimilar the chances of the forward and reverse calculations converging on the same free energy changes falls rapidly. As a result, these techniques are largely limited to point mutant comparisons. Larger differences quickly become intractable as the number of intermediate steps required for convergence grows.

7. In the Introduction, at page 1 (row 20), the authors refer to the use of steered MD in the prediction of relative binding affinity between wild type and mutant protein-protein complexes as a "new method".
This is an overrated sentence for two reasons: 1. the authors show a procedure, a protocol (if it was properly detailed), they do not develop any new methods; 2. a similar approach has already been reported
by Cuendet and Michielin as early as 2008, as the authors properly acknowledge in the Results section.
The sentence should be tuned down, and this also holds for the sentence at page 11 (rows 266, 267) where the auhtors state that they changed the scope of application of SMD simulations. 

Agreed. See point 2 for reviewer 1.

8. Page 4, row 71. Is the system size really of about 28,000 atoms? Systems of about 30,000 atoms are relatively small, whereas by looking at Figure 1B I would have expected at least 50,000 atoms. Please double check.

The system is indeed about 28,000 atoms.  We used a 5 Angstrom around the bound complex and left a 20 A buffer in the pulling direction.

9. Page 4, rows 74, 75: "This was accomplished by setting beta=1." What do the authors mean? What does the beta parameter stand for?

We meant the B-factor column in the pdb.  The sentence now reads.

In addition to the modeled system, for equilibration we generated a configuration file that fixed the $\alpha$-carbon backbone. This was accomplished by setting the B-factor column to 1 for the fixed atoms and to zero for all other atoms.

10. Page 4, row 84. The authors state that the exact input file is reported in the supplement. I wasn't able to find any input file in the supplement, but I apologize beforehand with the authors in case the input file was actually provided.
Please double check. Anyway, the authors should at least indicate in the main text very important simulation parameters such as the temperature control method employed and the cutoff radii for nonbonded interactions.

Apologies.  It was an oversight in the final submission.  They should now be included.

11. Page 6, rows 131, 132. Please provide some more details regarding the "pairwise.t.test function" and the "FDR p-value correction".

12. Page 8, row 171. Please avoid odd sentences such as "we generated a physically realistic simulation world", as this is what people usually do when performing Molecular Simulations, there is no need for such an emphasys in a scientific paper.

The sentence was removed.

13. It seems to me that the authors have a menageable amount of data. Just showing a force profile (Fig. 2) and the maximum force probability distribution (Fig. 3) for selected entries in the main text is ok, but the authors should also show all the force profiles and maximum force probability distributions for all the system they simulated in the supplement.

The total number of SMD runs was 550 so including all of the force curves seems impractical.  We have included a figure of the maximum force probability distribution.

14. Page 13, row 321. What do the auhtors mean with "unrestrained SMD"?

We removed the word 'unrestrained'.
